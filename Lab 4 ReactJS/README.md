#Muneemji - An expense tracker made with React-JS and TypeScript

I am sharing a flat with my friend and I share the various bills like cooking, electricity, Bike Maintenance(maybe), Rent, etc. Each time either of us will pay the amount.
I are keeping note of the expenses and at the end of the period of sharing a flat, the person who spent an excess amount shall pay the other. 
All this process is done manually as on date.

Being a techie, I have observed this problem and thought of making the process digital to an extent in the first version of the application. My main accomplishments are,

1.To create a json-server which can store the data for future use.

2.Make sure every input has an id and the user should not manually insert the id for the data.

3.To create a GUI structure where the data from json-server can be seen.

4.To create a GUI structure where you can fill the details needed to store in the server.

5.At the end of the data retrieved from server, show Total spent, person A spent, Person B spent, who pays to whom and how has to be paid by them at any given time.

6.View the Add new Item Form separately with the react router dom.
